# CatchTheMutants

For this lab, I will provide you with a method specification, one correct implementation, and 15 mutant implementations. 
Your job is to write a test suite that does NOT flag the correct implementation but does successfully reveal each mutant. 

You will write your tests in the `revealer.MutantRevealer` class and run the `testthetests.ReealingMutantsEvaluator` file to see how many mutants you successfully caught.
